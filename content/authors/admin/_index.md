  I am a master's student pursuing my Computer Engineering Degree at USC. My primary interests are Computer Networking and Embedded Systems. Before joining USC, I was working at Robert Bosch, India(RBEI - currently BGST) as a Software Engineer developing software for the Engine ECU Vehicle Communication Team. I am currently working as a Research Intern at USC Media Communications Lab (MCL) generating adversarial attacks for custom image classification pipelines.
  I am currently looking for entry level full time jobs relevant to Computer Networks, Embedded Systems and Computer Vision. Please feel free to reach out to me if you feel like my skillset aligns with your requirement
